# Machine Learning From Scratch

A repository to implement and understand core **Machine Learning algorithms from scratch** in Python. This project focuses on building algorithms without relying on high-level libraries like `scikit-learn` or `TensorFlow`, giving a deep understanding of the math and mechanics behind them.

## 🔍 Overview

Machine Learning from Scratch is a hands-on approach to learning ML concepts by coding them yourself. It covers:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalization, Standardization, Robust Scaling
  I will make more handson-files in the near future

Each implementation focuses on **clarity, simplicity, and educational value** rather than performance optimization.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `numpy` – for numerical computations
  - `pandas` – for data manipulation (optional for datasets)
